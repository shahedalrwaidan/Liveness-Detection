## Liveness detection 
    Liveness detection in biometrics is the system's ability to detect face is real from a live person present at the capture point or is fake, and it consists of a set of technical features to counter biometric spoofing attacks, in which a person's biometrics are used.

## Result 
  
   In this project ,We created a face liveness detection solution . To capture a face from a video, we used a face landmark algorithm. This has fed a different cnn model archiculture (CNN,VGG16,Resnet50 ). The obtained results show that ResNet50 performs better than other models in our dataset. However, there is a 2-5 percent chance of error in real life.
